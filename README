Welcome to BlueFin.

This software is supported on SLC5 and SLC6 machines
(and other variants of RedHat 5 and 6 distributions).
The CVMFS file system is required to use the ROOT and 
GCC libraries installed there.

To build the software: type 'make'.

You can also use the prebuilt bluefin binary in prebuilt/slc6.
In that case, please use the provided setup.csh and setup.sh
scripts in the same directory.

Some examples of using bluefin are in the tests.sh script.

For any question, please contact Andrea.Valassi(at)cern.ch.
